# The warning you are seeing relates to line endings in text files, which can differ between operating systems.

# - **LF (Line Feed)** is the standard line ending in Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS).
# - **CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed)** is the standard line ending in Windows.

# When you work with Git on Windows and share code with others using different operating systems (e.g., Linux), Git handles these line endings by converting them when necessary. The warning is saying that your notebook files (e.g., `.ipynb` files) currently have LF line endings, but when Git modifies them, it will replace LF with CRLF.

# This wonâ€™t affect the functionality of your Jupyter Notebooks, but you can prevent the warning by configuring Git to handle line endings automatically based on the operating system.

# To do this, you can run the following command:

git config --global core.autocrlf true


# This ensures that:
# - When checking out files, Git will convert LF to CRLF for Windows systems.
# - When committing, Git will convert CRLF back to LF, ensuring consistency.

# Would you like more details on how line endings work in Git, or do you want to move on to setting up Jupyter Notebooks?
